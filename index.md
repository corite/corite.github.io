Hi, thanks for visiting my page! I am a computer science student at FSU Jena interested mostly in technical topics such as OS design and computer architectures, but I am also curious about programming language design and compilation/interpretation.

I am passionate about software development, currently I mostly write Java but I want to get more into Rust and C(++) in the future.
