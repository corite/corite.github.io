Hi, thanks for visiting my page! I am a computer science student at TU Berlin. Some topics I like working with / learning about (in no particular order):

- OS kernel stuff (io and concurrency in particular)
- programming languages
- compilers, interpreters and everything in between
- Java (or more specifically JVM internals)
- Kubernetes
- Security & Exploits

I also occasionally attend CCC events and will probably be happy if you talk to me ^^. Apart from tech stuff I really like to read novels and watch movies and TV shows.
